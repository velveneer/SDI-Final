# Hetzner Cloud Setup

## Technical Background

Working with software defined infrastructur`requires a flexible and reproducible environment where infrastructure can be created, modified, and destroyed on demand.
A cloud provider offers:

- `On-Demand Resources`: Quickly create servers, networks, and other infrastructure components
- `Scalability`: Adjust resources dynamically as exercises become more complex
- `Isolation`: Work in a safe environment without affecting local systems
- `Collaboration`: Share access with teammates while maintaining security and role separation

In this course, a cloud platform is required to host virtual servers, configure networking, and deploy automation solutions.

Hetzner provides an offer for educational institutions to learn how to use these systems.
